title: Introduction

I am a highly driven, spirited and creative Mathematics and Business graduate with a keen interest in electricity markets, renewable energy, climate change and global supply chains. My interest in these fields has been fueled by my passion for identifying and solving problems.

Currently, I'm a graduate student in UBC's Master of Data Science program. It is my desire to immerse myself in environments rich in supply of new challenges and new opportunities to test and develop my skills while providing tangible quantifiable solutions.
